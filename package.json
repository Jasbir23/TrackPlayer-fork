Those can heavily affect the app stability and user experience.\n\nAll audio modules (like `react-native-sound`) don't play in a separated service on Android, which should **only** be used for simple audio tracks in foreground (such as sound effects, voice messages, etc)\n\n`react-native-music-controls` is meant for apps using those audio modules, although it has a few problems due to how the audio is not directly tied to the controls, it can be pretty useful for casting (such as Chromecast)\n\n`react-native-google-cast` works pretty well and also supports custom receivers, but it has fewer player controls, it's harder to integrate and still uses the Cast SDK v2\n\n## Example\n\nIf you want to get started with this module, check the [API](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player/wiki/API) page.\nIf you want detailed information about the API, check the [Documentation](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player/wiki/Documentation).\n```javascript\nimport TrackPlayer from 'react-native-track-player';\n\n// Creates the player\nTrackPlayer.setupPlayer().then(async () => {\n\n    // Adds a track to the queue\n    await TrackPlayer.add({\n        id: 'trackId',\n        url: require('track.mp3'),\n        title: 'Track Title',\n        artist: 'Track Artist',\n        artwork: require('track.png')\n    });\n\n    // Starts playing it\n    TrackPlayer.play();\n\n});\n```\n\n## Maintainers\n* Android: [Guilherme Chaguri](https://github.com/Guichaguri)\n* iOS: [David Chavez](https://github.com/dcvz)\n* Windows: [Guilherme Chaguri](https://github.com/Guichaguri)\n",
