## Why another music module?
After trying to team up modules like `react-native-sound`, `react-native-music-controls` and `react-native-google-cast`, I've noticed that their structure and the way should be tied together can cause a lot problems (mainly on Android). Those can heavily affect the app stability and user experience.

All audio modules (like `react-native-sound`) don't play in a separated service on Android, which should **only** be used for simple audio tracks in foreground (such as sound effects, voice messages, etc)

`react-native-music-controls` is meant for apps using those audio modules, although it has a few problems due to how the audio is not directly tied to the controls, it can be pretty useful for casting (such as Chromecast)

`react-native-google-cast` works pretty well and also supports custom receivers, but it has fewer player controls, it's harder to integrate and still uses the Cast SDK v2

## Example

If you want to get started with this module, check the [API](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player/wiki/API) page.
If you want detailed information about the API, check the [Documentation](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player/wiki/Documentation).
```javascript
import TrackPlayer from 'react-native-track-player';

// Creates the player
TrackPlayer.setupPlayer().then(async () => {

    // Adds a track to the queue
    await TrackPlayer.add({
        id: 'trackId',
        url: require('track.mp3'),
        title: 'Track Title',
        artist: 'Track Artist',
        artwork: require('track.png')
    });

    // Starts playing it
    TrackPlayer.play();

});
```
